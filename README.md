# to-do-list-javascript
A simple to do list I created to get some fresh experience with JavaScript.

You can add a task by writing in the text box and pressing the 'Add Task' button.
Once added, it will be added to a temporary list with a checkbox next to the item.

Click the checkbox when the task is completed and it will be given a strike through.
Click the button again to remove the strike through from the task.
